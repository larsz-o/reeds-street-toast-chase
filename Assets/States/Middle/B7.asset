  storyText: "You chose wisely. We put our noses to the grindstone and searched out
    one final treat. And street toast companion, we scored big. \n\nThe stars aligned:
    you sniffed out an entire box of pepperoni pizza and seconds later, I secured
    it under my paw. I could hear Lars' phone vibrating in his hand and knew we were
    golden. He picked up the incoming call and said those precious words, \"Hi Mom.\"
    I knew he'd be tied up for at least 10 minutes. As we devoured the entire pie
    in mere moments, we dreamed of pooping in the living room and blaming the cats.\n\nThe
    end.\n\n1. Play again"
