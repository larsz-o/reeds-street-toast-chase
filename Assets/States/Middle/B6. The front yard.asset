  storyText: "Ahhhh the great outdoors. Okay pal, here's the plan. We need to sniff
    out as much street toast as we can. This can be anything - pieces of bread, Dunkin
    Donuts bags, almond croissants. Whatever! I have been told that there are some
    things that are lethal to my species, including chicken bones and chocolate. We
    should probably avoid those things. Beware of other dogs who try to grab our toasts!
    \n\nLet's go! \n\n1. Start at it, we have a lot of walking to do!"
