  storyText: 'We have little lie down and try to look as sad as possible. Every once
    in a while, give a small howl. Whimper. We''re hungry, people! After what seems
    like half a day, one human, Sarah, emerges from the bathroom. Oh, I guess not
    everyone left after all.


    Sarah greets us with a nice pat and tells us what good boys we are. Let''s get
    ready to go outside! Which door should we wait by with our leash?


    1. Back door

    2. Front door'
