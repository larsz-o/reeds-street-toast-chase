  storyText: 'You''re interested in street toasts. I''m glad to hear it. I can use
    all of the help I can get. The first thing we need to do is convince one of the
    humans to take us outside. This will be easy. But we need to choose the human
    wisely. Once we''re out there, we simply smell around for toast left on the street.
    The humans don''t want us to eat the street toasts, so we''ll need to trick them
    - and avoid other predators - to eat as much street toast as possible.


    Our first decision: who to pick?


    1. Lars - is afraid of aggressive dogs, one of our enemies

    2. Sarah - can spot a street toast a mile away'
