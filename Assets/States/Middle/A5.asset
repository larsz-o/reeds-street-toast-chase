  storyText: "We made it outside! Lars has us on a short leash, but we're still managing
    to get in a lot of peeing and a lot of smells. So far, no toast. \n\nI'm getting
    a whiff of something crumbly and buttery just as I see Lars pulling out his phone
    to check his Fantasy Football lineup. His wavier wire picks come in today, so
    he'll be tied up for a while. \n\nLet's act fast. Do you want to distract Lars
    or snatch up the toast?\n\n1. Distract\n\n2. Snatch"
