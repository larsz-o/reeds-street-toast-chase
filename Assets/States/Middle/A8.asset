  storyText: "Wow, thanks! Let's try to find you some toast now. We prance down the
    street. It's trash day so there is a lot of possibility. As we make our way past
    each can, I sniff around for any stray snacks. There's a real nice odor coming
    from the one two houses down. \n\nWe arrive at the can and by golly I was right.
    I spot two perfect treats: a half full milkshake cup and a whole chicken carcass.
    OH BOY. Which do we choose?\n\n1. As fast as we can, shove our mouths into the
    milkshake cup and drink that buddy up.\n2. Teeth into the chicken carcass. There
    is a ton of meat on that still!."
