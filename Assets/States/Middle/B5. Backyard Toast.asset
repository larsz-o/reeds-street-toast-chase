  storyText: "Backyard street toast is less common than regular street toast, but
    it can be more refined. Let's try to dig up some treats out here. \n\nWe spend
    a few minutes digging around, but there's nothing but an old coffee cup out here.
    The humans must have cleaned up last night.\n\nI have another idea. We need to
    sneak out to get to the road. Which way should we go?\n\n1. Escape through the
    front - everyone should have their trash cans out for collection\n\n2. Sneak through
    the back to the alley - I think I saw an ice cream cone there last week."
