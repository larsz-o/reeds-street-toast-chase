  storyText: "It's finally morning! I've been waiting all night for this. \n\nTime
    for the morning walk! Usually there are lots of street toasts out there and I'm
    ready for my breakfast. Let's try to get one of the humans to walk us. \n\nWho
    will you choose?:\n1. Lars - is afraid of other dogs, might not be able to defend
    against intruders\n2. Sarah - will take a lot of pictures of you - might snatch
    up your toasts"
